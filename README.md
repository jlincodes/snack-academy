# SnackAcademy

## Background and Overview
Being a student is hard; being a student at a rigorous coding bootcamp is even more difficult. Lecture schedules are strict and the workload is endless. In addition to that, conveniently accessible, affordable, quality snacks and beverages are hard to come by.

That is where SnackAcademy comes in. SnackAcademy is a mobile app (iOS and Android compatible ) that App Academy students and staff can use to order and purchase quality snacks and beverages from our pop-up store.


## Technologies
The SnackAcademy mobile app is built on React Native and utilizes Stripe integration to securely store our customers' sensitive information, such as credit card information, and to process payment charges upon order submission. We chose to develop the app for both iOS and Android to capture the largest customer base possible.

## Features
### User authentication & verification of payment credentials
- Conveniently register users via name, email and payment credentials
- Secure storage of users' sensitive information through Stripe integration

## Future Plans

### Promotion of app and pop-up store
SnackAcademy will be promoted through word-of-mouth among students and staff and eventually launch its' pop-up store.

Technology-wise, we will further develop the administrative dashboard to assist in the development of the business, including the following features:

- Allows Admin to add new products/update existing products
- Display analytics
  - Number of unique active users per day
  - Items ordered and quantities of each item ordered => calculate expenses
  - Revenue and profit (revenue - expenses)
