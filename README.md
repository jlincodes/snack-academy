# SnackAcademy

## Background and Overview
### The Problem:
Tight schedules at App Academy, limited in-house refreshments, and prices at nearby stores make it inconvenient and expensive to buy quality coffee and snacks while at school.

### The Solution:
Create a refreshments pop-up store powered by a native mobile app to manage orders and process payments via Stripe.

## Functionality and MVP
### User authentication & verification of payment credentials
- Conveniently register users via emails and payment credentials
- Integrate third party storage of payment credentials through Stripe

## Group Members and Work Breakdown
Our flex project group consists of three members: Kenta Kodama, Logan Cooper,
and Julie Lin. Each member will serve as the point-person for a specific area of the project.

|Member Name|Primary responsibilities|Additional details|
|---|---|---|
|Kenta|React Native frontend|Primary focus will be the UI/UX of SnackAcademy App|
|Logan|Stripe Payments|Focus is on Stripe integration into Rails/React Native|
|Julie|Rails backend|Upon completion of backend, will hop onto frontend|
